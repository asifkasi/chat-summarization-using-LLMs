    "Steviol glycosides are the sweet compounds extracted from the leaves of the stevia plant (Stevia rebaudiana). They are used as natural, zero-calorie sweeteners in a variety of commercial food products. Due to their high sweetness intensity (200–400 times sweeter than sucrose), only small amounts are needed to achieve the desired level of sweetness.Typical Usage Levels of Steviol Glycosides in Commercial Food Products:\n",

    "o\tAmount: 0.02–0.06% of the product weight.\n",
    "o\tPurpose: Sweetens without adding sugar, often combined with bulking agents like erythritol to replicate texture.\n",
    "3.\tBaked Goods (e.g., cakes, cookies, muffins):\n",
    "o\tAmount: 0.01–0.04% of the product weight.\n",
    "o\tPurpose: Provides sweetness, often used with sugar alcohols or fibers to compensate for sugar's role in structure and texture.\n",
    "4.\tConfectionery (e.g., candies, gum, chocolate):\n",
    "o\tAmount: 0.02–0.05% of the product weight.\n",
    "o\tPurpose: Sweetens low-sugar or sugar-free products, sometimes combined with other sweeteners for taste balance.\n",
    "5.\tSauces and Dressings:\n",
    "o\tAmount: 0.01–0.03% of the product weight.\n",
    "o\tPurpose: Adds sweetness to low-calorie or sugar-free sauces like ketchup, barbecue sauce, and salad dressings.\n",
    "6.\tSnacks (e.g., bars, granola, crisps):\n",
    "o\tAmount: 0.01–0.05% of the product weight.\n",
    "o\tPurpose: Reduces sugar content while maintaining sweetness in healthy or low-calorie snack products.\n",
    "7.\tProcessed Foods (e.g., jams, jellies, canned fruit):\n",
    "o\tAmount: 0.02–0.05% of the product weight.\n",
    "o\tPurpose: Provides sweetness in reduced-sugar or sugar-free versions.\n",
    "Key Considerations for Usage:\n",
    "•\tSweetness Potency: Steviol glycosides are extremely sweet; precise blending is required to avoid over-sweetness or bitter aftertaste.\n",
    "•\tBlends with Other Sweeteners: Often used in combination with sugar alcohols (e.g., erythritol) or other high-intensity sweeteners to improve flavor and reduce bitterness.\n",
    "•\tRegulatory Limits: Maximum allowable usage levels may vary by region and food type. Manufacturers must comply with local food safety regulations.\n",
    "Regulatory and Safety Considerations:\n",
    "•\tGRAS Status: Steviol glycosides are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA and approved for use in many countries.\n",
    "•\tLabeling: On ingredient lists, they may appear as \"steviol glycosides,\" \"stevia extract,\" or \"Rebaudioside A\" (depending on the specific compound used).\n",
    "Shelf Life and Storage:\n",
    "•\tShelf Life: Typically 2–3 years when stored properly.\n",
    "•\tStorage Conditions: Keep in a cool, dry place in an airtight container to prevent moisture absorption and degradation.\n",
    "Summary:\n",
    "The typical amount of steviol glycosides used in commercial food products ranges from 0.01% to 0.06% of the product weight, depending on the sweetness required and the application. They are widely used in beverages, dairy, baked goods, confectionery, sauces, and snacks to replace sugar and create lower-calorie options. Manufacturers must carefully balance usage to ensure optimal sweetness while minimizing potential aftertaste.\n",
